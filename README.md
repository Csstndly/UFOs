# UFOs

## Overview of Project
### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage with an interactive table through HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. The webpage gives a nice visual that has a summary of what the webpage is about with pictures, titles, and headers. The analysis of this report is to explain how the created table and filters could be used by a user to search for UFO sightings. 


## Results
### Webpage Criteria

When looking for UFO sightings a user would see the listed filters beside the data table. The user would choose one or more filters to input into the boxes. Once the data is put in the user would press enter or click outside of the box to get the new filtered table. User could scroll through the information desired. The user could continue to add more filters or delete the user already in place and choose a new filter to go through the data.


## Summary
### Improvements and Drawbacks

In all this is a good starting webpage. One drawback from the new design is that it isn’t adaptable to devices that aren’t a computer. It’s too big and doesn’t shrink in size. This can make the user’s experience difficult and run them off. Also, there isn’t any data outside of the year 2010. This will limit the user’s experience with the website and it might make them feel a bit disappointed about the information that is available. So, adding diverse data could make the experience more interesting. Another possible improvement is with the filter selection. Shape isn’t a great filter as under the category of shapes are light, formation, and fireball to name a few. Maybe even renaming it to “appearance” would be better. Another would be to add a comment when none of the data matches the criteria to say “information unavailable”.
